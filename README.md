## 🧠 Who am I?

I’m an engineer who enjoys **understanding how systems behave under pressure**.

Not just building apps —  
but **deploying, observing, breaking, fixing, and improving systems** until they make sense.

I’m fascinated by what happens *after* the code is written:
- When containers crash  
- When networks misbehave  
- When latency spikes  
- When systems need to recover automatically  

That’s where real engineering begins.

## ⚙️ What I’m obsessed with

```text
🌐 Networking        → packets, protocols, traffic, failures
🔐 Cybersecurity     → boundaries, trust, risk, defense
📡 Private 5G / Edge → performance, latency, infrastructure
☁️ Cloud Native      → containers, orchestration, scaling
📊 Observability     → metrics, dashboards, alerts
🧯 Reliability       → failure scenarios, recovery, runbooks

I love projects that feel real, even if they’re small.

## 🛠️ How I like to build systems

I follow a simple mindset:

> “If it can fail, it should be observed.  
> If it fails, recovery should be clear.”

That usually looks like:

1. **Design** something minimal but realistic
2. **Containerize** it
3. **Deploy** it (often on Kubernetes)
4. **Add monitoring** & dashboards
5. **Break it** on purpose
6. **Observe** what happens
7. **Write down** how to recover

**Learning happens in steps 5 → 7.**

## 📌 Current focus

* 🧠 **Deepening Kubernetes & SRE fundamentals**
* 📊 **Observability** (Prometheus, Grafana, alerts)
* 🌐 **Networking internals** & traffic behavior
* ☁️ **Cloud & infrastructure automation**
* 🔐 **Security-aware system design**

## 📈 Philosophy

I don’t aim to “know everything”. I aim to:

1. Ask good questions
2. Build small, real systems
3. Observe them carefully
4. Improve them deliberately

That’s how strong engineers are formed.
